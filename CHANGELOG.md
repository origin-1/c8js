<a name="v0.8.0"></a>
## [v0.8.0](https://github.com/origin-1/c8js/releases/tag/v0.8.0) (2024-07-25)

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/origin-1/c8js/releases/tag/v0.7.0) (2024-04-24)

* On Windows, `commands.npm` and `commands.npx` will now resolve to the path of a .js file, not a .cmd file like in previous versions of c8js. This is because new versions of Node.js prevent the execution of .cmd files on Windows when no shell process is spawned (see [the announcement](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/april-2024-security-releases-2)).
* Fixed documentation pages.

<a name="v0.3.0"></a>
## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/origin-1/c8js/releases/tag/v0.3.0) (2022-09-26)

* Fix: c8js works again in Node.js < 14.13.
* The new option `throwExecError` has replaced `failFast`.
* All c8js functions now throw an exception when passed unknown options.

* Signals sent to the process running c8js are no longer passed down to a subprocess.

* Improved performance when the option `maxBuffer` is set to `Infinity`.
* Extended documentation.
* Linking to the new homepage.
* Removed a few unused dependencies.
